	<p>In part 1 of this two-part GitHub tutorial, we examined the main uses<br>
	for GitHub and began the process of signing up for a GitHub account and creating our<br>
	own local repository for code.<p>

	<p>Now that these steps have been accomplished, let's add the first part of your project<br>
	now by making your first commit to HitHub. When we last left off, we'd created a local<br>
	repository called MyProject, which, when viewed in the comman line, looks like this sreenshot.</p>

	<p>On your next line, typ: touch Readme.txt. This, agian, is not a Git command. It's another<br>
	standard navigational command prompt. touch really means "create." Whatever you write after<br>
	that is the name of the thing created. If you go to your folder using Finder or the Start <br>
	menu, you'll see an empty Readme.txt file is now inside. You could have also made something<br>
	like "Readme.doc" or "Kiwi.gif", just for kicks</p>

	<p>You can clearly see your new Readme file. But can Git? Let's find out. Type: git status<br>
	The command line, usually so passive up to this point, will reply with a few lines of text <br>
	similar to this: #On branch master<br>
	#Untracked files:<br>
	#(use "git add . . . " to include in what will be committed)<br>
	#<br>
	#<br>
	# Readme.txt<br>
	What's going on? First of all, you're on the master branch<br>
	of your project, which makes sense since we haven't "branched off"<br>
	of it. There's no reason to, since we're working alone. Secondly<br>
	Readme.txt is listed as an "untracked" file, which means Git is ignoring<br>
	it for now. To make Git notice that the file is there, type:<br>
	git add Readme.txt<br>
	Notice how the command line gave you a hint there> All right, we've<br>
	added our first file, so it's time to take a "snapshot" of the project so <br>
	far, or "commite" it:<br>
	git commit -m "Add Readme.txt"</p>
	<br><br>

	<p>The -m flag, as noted in the terms directory in Part 1,<br>
	simply indicates that the following text should be read as a message. <br>
	Notice the commit message is written in present tense. You should<br>
	always write your commands in present tense because version control is all <br>
	about flexibility through time. Your're not writing about what a comiit did,<br>
	because you may always revert to earlier. You're writing about what a commit does.<br>
